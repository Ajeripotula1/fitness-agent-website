# Requirements Document - MVP Version

## Introduction

The FitnessAgent Website MVP is a single-page application (SPA) that provides users with personalized fitness and nutrition planning through an AI agent built with Strands SDK. The system uses scientific tools to create evidence-based workout and meal plans. The MVP focuses on core functionality: user authentication, profile creation, AI-powered plan generation using BMI/BMR/TDEE calculations, plan display and acceptance, with basic plan regeneration capabilities. This streamlined version delivers a complete user experience for getting personalized fitness plans within a 3-day development timeline.
