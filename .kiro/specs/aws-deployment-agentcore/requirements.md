# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves deploying the existing fitness agent application to AWS cloud infrastructure, with the agent component migrated to use AgentCore for improved scalability, reliability, and management. The deployment will maintain the current functionality while leveraging cloud-native services and AgentCore's agent orchestration capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want the fitness agent application deployed to AWS, so that it can scale automatically and be accessible to users globally with high availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the frontend SHALL be accessible via a public URL with HTTPS
2. WHEN the backend API is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible via a secure API endpoint
3. WHEN traffic increases THEN the system SHALL automatically scale to handle the load
4. WHEN a component fails THEN the system SHALL automatically recover without user intervention
5. IF the database connection is lost THEN the system SHALL retry connections and maintain data integrity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent functionality migrated to AgentCore, so that agent interactions are more reliable and can be monitored effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests fitness advice THEN the system SHALL use AgentCore to process the request
2. WHEN AgentCore processes a request THEN it SHALL maintain the same response quality as the current implementation
3. WHEN agent interactions occur THEN they SHALL be logged and monitorable through AgentCore's dashboard
4. IF AgentCore is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and fallback responses
5. WHEN agent responses are generated THEN they SHALL maintain compatibility with existing frontend components

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want infrastructure as code for the deployment, so that the environment can be reproduced and managed consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the infrastructure THEN it SHALL be defined using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools
2. WHEN changes are made to infrastructure THEN they SHALL be version controlled and reviewable
3. WHEN deploying to different environments THEN the same IaC templates SHALL be reusable
4. IF infrastructure needs to be recreated THEN it SHALL be possible using the IaC definitions
5. WHEN infrastructure is provisioned THEN it SHALL follow AWS security best practices

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the deployed application to maintain all current functionality, so that my fitness planning experience remains seamless.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application THEN all current features SHALL work identically to the local version
2. WHEN I create an account THEN my data SHALL be securely stored in the cloud database
3. WHEN I generate fitness plans THEN the agent SHALL provide the same quality recommendations
4. WHEN I use the application THEN response times SHALL be comparable or better than local deployment
5. IF I encounter errors THEN they SHALL be handled gracefully with appropriate user feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment, so that code changes can be deployed safely and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN automated tests SHALL run before deployment
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the application SHALL be automatically deployed to staging environment
3. WHEN staging deployment is verified THEN production deployment SHALL be possible with approval
4. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback to the previous version
5. WHEN deployments occur THEN they SHALL be logged and auditable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want monitoring and logging for the deployed application, so that I can track performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running THEN system metrics SHALL be collected and displayed in dashboards
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient detail for debugging
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN alerts SHALL be triggered automatically
4. WHEN investigating issues THEN logs SHALL be searchable and filterable
5. IF security events occur THEN they SHALL be detected and reported immediately
