# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The FitnessAgent Website is a single-page application (SPA) that provides users with personalized fitness and nutrition planning through a conversational AI agent built with Strands SDK and deployed on AgentCore Runtime. The system uses structured reasoning and scientific tools to create evidence-based workout and meal plans. The application guides users through goal setting, scientific calculation of nutritional requirements using BMI, BMR, and activity-based formulas, AI-generated plan creation with conversational refinement capabilities, and daily plan consumption. The agent acts like a knowledgeable fitness coach, allowing dynamic interactions where users can request substitutions, shift focus, or update metrics, with the system reasoning through requests to regenerate appropriate outputs.

## Requirements

5. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain the session throughout the application

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input my fitness goals and personal information, so that the AI can generate a customized plan that matches my objectives and constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the goal input page THEN the system SHALL display forms for fitness goals, physical metrics, equipment availability, and workout preferences
2. WHEN a user selects a fitness goal THEN the system SHALL accept options including lose weight, gain muscle, maintain weight, or body recomposition
3. WHEN a user inputs weight and height THEN the system SHALL validate the data and use it for BMI and caloric intake calculations
4. WHEN a user specifies available equipment THEN the system SHALL accept options including dumbbells, bench, gym access, no weights, resistance bands, and other equipment types
5. WHEN a user sets workout duration THEN the system SHALL accept the preferred minutes per workout session
6. WHEN a user sets workout frequency THEN the system SHALL accept the preferred number of workout days per week
7. WHEN a user clicks "generate plan" THEN the system SHALL initiate the AI plan generation process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI agent to generate scientifically-grounded workout and meal plans using structured reasoning and calculation tools, so that I have evidence-based plans tailored to my specific goals and constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plan generation process starts THEN the system SHALL calculate caloric requirements using BMI, BMR, and activity-based formulas
2. WHEN calculating nutritional needs THEN the system SHALL determine macronutrient requirements based on fitness goals and scientific guidelines
3. WHEN creating meal plans THEN the system SHALL generate balanced meals that align with calculated caloric and macro targets
4. WHEN generating workout plans THEN the system SHALL create a weekly workout calendar that adapts to available days, time constraints, and equipment
5. WHEN structuring workout plans THEN the system SHALL ensure full-body balance and progression with appropriate exercise selection
6. WHEN assigning workout days THEN the system SHALL use labels such as push, pull, legs, upper, lower, full body, arms, cardio, high intensity, or rest day
7. WHEN the agent uses structured reasoning THEN the system SHALL leverage scientific tools and evidence-based approaches for plan creation
8. WHEN plan generation is complete THEN the system SHALL display the results on the plan review page

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have conversational interactions with the AI agent to refine my plan, so that I can get personalized adjustments that feel like working with a knowledgeable fitness coach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plan review page loads THEN the system SHALL display the workout plan in a weekly view and the daily diet plan
2. WHEN a user wants to accept the plan THEN the system SHALL save the plan to the database and redirect to the daily tracker page
3. WHEN a user wants to update metrics THEN the system SHALL redirect back to the goal input page with previously entered information pre-filled
4. WHEN a user initiates a conversation with the agent THEN the system SHALL provide a dynamic, conversational interface for plan refinement
5. WHEN a user asks for substitutions THEN the agent SHALL reason through the request and provide appropriate alternatives 
6. WHEN a user wants to shift focus THEN the agent SHALL understand the intent and regenerate relevant portions of the plan
7. WHEN a user updates metrics or preferences THEN the agent SHALL recalculate scientific formulas, evaluate contraints and adjust plans accordingly
8. WHEN the agent processes requests THEN the system SHALL use structured reasoning to ensure changes maintain plan balance and effectiveness
9. WHEN plan modifications are made THEN the system SHALL regenerate appropriate outputs and update the displayed plan
10. WHEN conversational interactions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain context and memory of previous exchanges
11. WHEN users make requests THEN the agent SHALL respond in a knowledgeable, coach-like manner with explanations for recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access and track my daily and weekly fitness plans, so that I can follow my personalized routine and monitor my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the daily tracker page THEN the system SHALL display a weekly view with workout categories for each planned day
2. WHEN displaying the weekly view THEN the system SHALL show generalized workout labels such as push, pull, legs, upper, lower, full body, arms, cardio, high intensity, or rest day
3. WHEN a user clicks on a specific day THEN the system SHALL render the complete workout details for that selected day
4. WHEN displaying daily information THEN the system SHALL show the daily diet with macros, ingredients, and high-level instructions
5. WHEN organizing meal information THEN the system SHALL categorize meals by type such as breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner, or cheat meal
6. WHEN a user wants to modify their plan THEN the system SHALL provide navigation back to the plan review and update page
7. WHEN displaying workout and diet information THEN the system SHALL present the data in an organized, easy-to-follow format

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to leverage the Strands SDK and AgentCore Runtime architecture for reliable performance and data persistence, so that I have a seamless and responsive fitness coaching experience.
